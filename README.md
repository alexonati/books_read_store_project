# Book Store Project

 Small project that I built following an example, project that showcases a console-based book store system that allows users to enter and retrieve book
details, as well as mark books as read (meaning theyâ€™ve finished reading them already), and delete existing books.
To store the book objects an in-memory database (a Python list), a .txt file, a .json file an an sqlite db are used.

My key takeaways were:
 - how to store objects (data) in different file types & to a SQLite db.
